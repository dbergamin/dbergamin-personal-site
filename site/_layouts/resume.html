            <p>IT professional with a track record in increasing the rate at which teams can safely deliver customer value. I specialise in automating release processes, building the tools and fostering the culture that shifts quality and security left.</p>

            <div id="career-summary" class="resume-item-details">
              <p>Started out as <span id="cv-link-servicerocket-consultant" class="cv-link">consultant/developer at ServiceRocket</span> selling, speccing and delivering add-ons and migrations for the Atlassian ALM tools, and then tossing them over the 'wall' to customers ops teams.</p>
              <p>Craving the satisfaction of longer-term ownership and continuous longer-term feature delivery, I moved to <span id="cv-link-tfnsw-cloud" class="cv-link">Transport for NSW</span>, first building out a greenfield platform to deliver their revamped primary customer facing web property transportnsw.info, and then operating and improving both the platform and the website in production for a year and a half.</p>
              <p>My recent work at WorldFirst took me into the operational sysadmin territory I missed by jumping straight from being a developer to building immutable infrastructure and serverless solutions. There was an need to continously deliver applications on a fleet of bare-metal servers running in co-lo datacentres for the first six months, after which I took a lead role in their migration to public cloud for the latter part of the engagement.</p>
              <p>I'm always on the lookout for my next challenge. Please <a href="mailto:{{ site.contact_email }}" class="contact-button no-print" itemprop="email">get in touch</a> if you'd like to work with me on a passion project or commercial engagement.</p>

              <p class="resume-item-copy">I worked on the transportnsw.info delivery team for just over two years, wearing many hats in the process:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>As a developer in the cross functional developer productivity and cloud team, I worked on continuous delivery enablers, aiming to safely ship releases after each sprint with high confidence.</li>
                <li>As an infrastructure engineer, I used a combination of CloudFormation (DSL), Docker, Jenkins, Ansible & Ruby to maintain infrastructure in code as a deployable artifact. In the latter part of the project this shifted to working with AWS Lambda for a lot of new-build functionality.</li>
                <li>As a SME in Atlassian productivity tools, I advise on and implemented custom solutions across the Transport cluster that utilise Atlassian applications (JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket) as a platform.</li>
