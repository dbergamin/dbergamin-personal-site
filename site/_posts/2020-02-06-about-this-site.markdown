Hi, internet! I've set up this site to inspire a day-to-day journalling habit when I run into ideas or problems that interest me, with an ambition of leaving a more personalised digital footprint than possible on standard socials. 

I've been obsessed with the web as a platform since discovering the wonders of Geocities pages as a kid - a world of flashing, scrolling, text, garish backgrounds crafted by geeky teenagers that organically sprung up inside our repository of all of humanity's recorded knowledge with no entry barrier aside from some basic technical skills. Deeply personal creations by people with something interesting to share on a more appealing outlet than the local paper -- Charles' guide to [self-touring Europe by bike][euro-bike-touring], Susan's journey to find [the perfect sourdough][susans-sourdough].

The tech stack here is as plain as practical; with the blog powered by [Jekyll][jekyll-gh] and a bunch of static pages built with HTML5, CSS3 (compiled from SCSS to help keep things consistant) and a little bit of [Vanilla JS][vanilla-js]. The Jekyll minima theme provided an excellent foundation to get started, which I've trimmed down where possible. Page weight is light enough to keep things unminified for the curious, while still loading in a snappy fashion.

In time, I hope for this site to carry a bit of that early internet, personal page spirit forward. The source for this site and build pipelines is all available on [Github][github-dbergamin-personal-site] under the MIT license - please feel free to copy and re-use anything as you please. I myself lifted the Cloudformation for the web infrastructure and deploy pipelines from [jenseickmeyer's][jenseickmeyer] excellent resource.
