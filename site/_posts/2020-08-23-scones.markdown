What else do you do in lockdown?

After setting aside some time each week to fatten up my household with yet another batch of scones, we have a verdict. 8 recipe variations, three different flours, and many bakes later, I present batch #6. Made and remade a few times with success.

----
**Dry**
- 280g (~2 cups) sifted plain flour. I found [Doves Farm][doves-farm] worked best.
- 2T caster sugar
- 1/2t table salt
- 1t baking soda
- 1.5t baking powder

**Wet**
- 80g cold butter
- 2/3 cup semi-skimmed milk
- Half a lemon
- 1 egg

**Tools**
- Medium or large mixing bowl
- Butter knife
- Fork
- Rolling pin
- Pastry brush
- A scone cutter or appropriately sized glass. I like a 6-7cm diameter.

----

#### Process
1. Preparation:
  - Preheat oven to 200C fan-forced.
  - Put your butter in the freezer so it stays nice and cold throughout the process.
  - Squeeze your half-lemon into the milk and stir gently. Surprisingly, this 'substitute buttermilk' tended to produce better results than using actual buttermilk.

2. In a mixing bowl, combine all of the dry ingredients.

3. Take the butter out of the freezer and slice into small pieces (~1cm cubes). Add to the dry ingredients and rub together with your fingertips till the mixture looks like it a mix of flour and chunky breadcrumbs.

4. Beat the egg with the soured milk with a fork. Add 80% of this mixture to the mixing bowl, reserving 20% for brushing the tops before baking.

5. Use your knife to bring the mixing bowl together with cutting and folding movements. Do not overwork or knead – this would develop the gluten, yielding tough, bready scones.

6. The mixture should be sticky but hold together well enough. Turn out onto a floured work surface and bring it together. I like to bring all the edges into the centre like I'm creating a vaguely rectangular ball, and then flip and roll out gently with a rolling pin till about 2.5cm thick.

7. Flour the rim of the glass or scone cutter and cut scones by pushing the glass or cutter down and giving a gentle quarter-twist. Bring the leftover dough together and repeat.

8. Arrange the scones on a lightly floured baking sheet. Brus1h the tops –_only_ the tops, not the sides– with the reserved egg/milk mixture. 

9. Bake on an upper shelf until they look lightly browned and done. Usually 12 - 15 mins.

10. Enjoy! I usually serve these lightly toasted with a dollop of clotted or dense whipped cream and strawberry jam, but we've found homemade applesauce to be a surprisingly good topping if you're not a fan of cream.

#### Notes
Every flour and every palate is different. Try to get a feel for the stickiness of the dough at step 6, and have a play with the quantity of milk to work out what you like!

P.S. scone – rhymes with gone, not cone!
