Take a look at these people. Which ones would you guess work as software developers?

Although rational thought will tell us that choice of clothing and appearance has no bearing on technical ability, many of us – myself included – make an unconscious assumption that the people on the left are more likely to be good software developers than those on the right, something that, whether they like it or not, can work to the advantage of those that look and dress like those people on the left.

Whilst I'd expect that we would reassess our assumptions after working with the pictured people for some time, an initial unconscious bias can have lasting effects if we're not careful. Starting off with the benefit of the doubt can be a powerful thing.

Think about a working relationship that has begun with an instant, mutual respect, afforded to you from the beginning, and there to be lost. Your contributions are assumed to have merit until they are proven to not, and you have the freedom to speak at a higher level without having to constantly 'show your working', so to speak. For me, this is a strong foundation for a good, productive working relationship.

Now, think about a relationship that started out the opposite way – your contributions were instinctively rebutted; you looked to discuss an advanced concept but got questioned on basics; for one reason or another, you feel that you must work for the respect others are afforded upfront. With time and effort, this relationship can still evolve in a good way... but it's going to take longer to get there, and the initial adversarial nature can easily fracture things beyond repair.

I wanted to write this after catching up with a friend on the weekend and hearing about her experience at a coding bootcamp. Aside from the good parts, it hadn't taken long on a group project for her to notice something – when contributing to discussions, the first reaction from some team members was to outright ignore her, or instictively respond leading with a 'but' before taking time to properly consider what was said. More than once, things had even circled round after a few minutes, with one of the men on the team later suggesting the same thing... only this time the idea stuck.

Under the surface, this isn't necessarily a conscious response out of some personal vendetta – all the pop culture that we've consumed, the news we've watched glorifying an overwhelmingly white\*, male crowd of tech billionaires, and life experiences with geeky male nephews/cousins combine to shape our attitudes.

So, what can we do to make things better? For me, it's something like:

1. Acknowledging my unconscious biases – it can help to remember that I'm not at fault for having them.

2. Recognising how they can be counter-productive – to use my earlier example, delaying or preventing valuable relationships from reaching a productive point. There's a laundry list of ways biases can backfire; it's useful to spend a minute coming up with a few more examples of your own. 

3. Accepting that whilst it's not my fault per se, I have an opportunity to make life easier for ourselves and others by doing something about this.

4. Finally, mentally commiting to recognising my biases when they arise, 'catching' and neutralising them before they can influence my behaviour and the way I respond to others.

Even just doing the above, sadly, I feel like I'm ahead of the curve. But going further, those of us in positions of power and influence can help balance the image of tech, working towards reshaping the unconscious attitudes of the next generation. Because this is a structural, deep-rooted problem. Mentally catching and correcting unconscious bias has been a lifelong exercise for me, despite a lot of rational evidence to the contrary. Which leads me to the final part of this post.

<sup>\*To keep this post relatively short and digestible, I'm keeping the focus on gender bias, but the concepts have a more general application.</sup>

With today being International Women's Day, it's an opportunistic time to acknowledge, thank and celebrate a few of the women that I've had the privilege of learning from throughout my working life. A reminder to us all that great people in tech don't all look like our hooded Hollywood hacker above. I've limited myself to one person from each place I've worked, which leaves many very deserving names aside – if you're one of them, I'm sorry and trust you understand!

- [Kristie Bergamin][kristie-linkedin] (CTO, Payreq): A big part of why I got into the tech industry in the first place. You spent hours teaching this annoying cousin and aspiring teenage lawyer how to write VBA on an old Pentium in the playroom at Nonna's place. Thank you for sharing your passion for code and technology and setting me down a very satisfying path, and the support you've continued to grant me over the years.

- [Jennifer Cheung][jen-linkedin] (TAM / Solution Architect, Atlassian): I found your empathy and reliability as a manager of people and projects to be remarkable, not to mention your technical skill and mentorship to me as a consultant. Thank you for creating an environment where I had the trust, autonomy and safety net to step outside my comfort zone and develop my skills while delivering challenging client-facing work.

- [Sherrie Killiby][sherrie-linkedin] (Director of Digital Customer Information Services, Transport for NSW): I didn't properly understand the role of Product Owner (PO), and the outsize impact a good one could have until I had the privilege of working with Sherrie, who at the time was the PO for https://transportnsw.info. I am extremely proud of the product and how we went about building it, in no small part thanks to your remarkable efforts, Sherrie.

- [Emese (Kovacs) Ban][emese-linkedin] (Platform Engineering Tribe Lead, WorldFirst): Emese, you are an absolute force of nature, and the most effective instigator and executor of change that I've had the pleasure of working with. A lot of businesses can hire a Devops or Platform Engineer and have them automate releases; but Emese taught me how good, consistent tooling and thoughtful pairing can lead development teams towards taking responsibility for release processes and infrastructure whilst maintaining quality. Thank you.
