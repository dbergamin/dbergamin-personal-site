While everyone has their part to play in combating the pandemic, a lot of us in the knowledge worker pool have it relatively easy, all other things being equal. Stay inside, work from home, avoid unnecessary person-to-person interaction, enjoy the extra 50 bucks a week saved on transport costs, and try not to think too much about your decimated retirement fund for now ðŸ™ƒ.

I needed to write to find an outlet for the powerful swell of gratitude I am feeling, for all those in essential jobs who continue to go out to work and shoulder personal risk for the good of us all. They are keeping the lights on and maintaining the societal infrastructure that needs to be working for me to eke out a living from a keyboard in my bedroom, and I am immensely grateful. Doctors and nurses, teaching staff (*hi, Mum*), emergency services personnel (*and Dad!*), delivery riders and drivers, supermarket staff, utilities maintainers, waste disposal professionals, and so many others whose labour we depend on.

An outlet for feelings of helplessness and heartbreak for small business owners and casual staff in the myriad non-essential industries. People who are no longer able to earn a living in their profession, and the otherwise viable businesses that cannot weather this storm. Providers of travel, entertainment, and hospitality that we will turn to for pleasure once things improve.

**What to do?** We try to help where we can, buying local, but it's not enough, it doesn't scale, and I'm feeling relief where institutions are stepping in to help â€“ from the government covering pay for shut out workers in the UK, to private owners who are forgoing some or all of their rent / ROI for this period.

I find myself reflecting on modern finance and capital ownership structures; internationally diversified and fragmented, everyone owing someone else. Even if all owners in the chain were ready and willing to give up their returns for a period, it seems impossible to gather the consensus and mechanisms required to evenly bear the cost of relief for a struggling operator at the end, say, a bunch of businesses in a plaza falling behind on rent and laying off staff. The optimist in me looks to a future of digitised smart contracts, where, in a few decades, this might even be a tractable problem.  

Ideally, I'd like to be able to contribute to a levy, covered by those able to continue working uninterrupted. It would provide tax-relief based bonuses for essential workers, and a safety net for non-essential businesses and their laid-off staff. 

**For now**, the best I've got in practice is random acts of kindness for those in my circles shouldering disproportionately more of the burden in this crisis. 

Let us give gifts, let brave friends know that you admire and appreciate their work, and keep on keeping the lights on in the digital world from the comfort of our homes. Go team!
