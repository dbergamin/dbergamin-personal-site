In this series of posts, I want to record and share things that recently 'sparked joy' in my life on a day-to-day basis. No sponsors or affiliate links, just things I want to share along with a few specific things I liked about them.

#### Interesting Media
{: .underline}

{: .light-emphasis-panel}
> [**'Conversations' podcast: The story of the Snowy**][story-of-the-snowy]
> + A great episode from my favourite podcast. Richard and Sarah are wonderful interviewers with a steady stream of interesting guests.
> + Guest Siobhan McHugh tells stories from the Snowy Hydro Project – a nation-building project bringing together over 100,000 workers from around the world to create a world-leading hydro power source. 
> + Inspirational, funny and tragic in the space of 50 minutes, this is well worth a listen (or two!).

{: .light-emphasis-panel}
> [**Facemasks: Much more than you wanted to know**][facemasks-post]
> + Super interesting roundup of things we know about mask effectiveness in the context of SARS-CoV-2.
> + tl;dr, N95/P2 respirators are likely ineffective for general public use; surgical masks have gotten an undeserved bad rap and are likely useful in lower-risk community settings.

####  Tech
{: .underline}

{: .light-emphasis-panel .trailing-image}
> [**ncspot**][ncspot]: Terminal-based Spotify client (premium users only), surprisingly functional.
> + Drastically lower memory footprint (50MB vs 1GB), which is ideal for ultrabooks.
> + Works well on Ubuntu, likely also on other Linux/*BSD flavours and MacOS, not sure about Windows.
> + Uses a reverse-engineered streaming API so probably against ToS, use at own risk.

#### Cooking
{: .underline}

{: .light-emphasis-panel .trailing-image}
> [**Glass Potatoes**][glass-potatoes]: A dead easy, super delicious way to do roast potatoes.
> + Recipe courtesy of Annabel Crabb, from cookbook [Special Guest: Recipes for the happily imperfect host][special-guest-cookbook].
> + I used King Edward potatoes, Iliada EVOO and Cornish sea salt with a sprinkle of dried rosemary and thyme. Simply fantastic.

{: .light-emphasis-panel}
> [**Iliada Extra Virgin Olive Oil**][iliada-olive-oil]: Good all-rounder EVOO. Manages a neutral taste without being boring.
> + Can't talk glass potatoes without mentioning this. I was lost without my trusty Cobram Estate till I found Iliada.
> + The best value EVOO I've been properly happy with in the UK. We use it for anything except deep frying.
> + Fresh stock (~16+ months till best before) usually available at larger Sainsburys, Waitrose or Wholefoods. 

#### Games
{: .underline}

{: .light-emphasis-panel .trailing-image}
> [**Kanagawa**][kanagawa]: Light strategy boardgame
> + Beautifully crafted card drafting game themed around artists in a studio training to produce masterpieces.
> + Plays very well with four players; enough depth to be engaging without being stressful.   
>

{: .light-emphasis-panel .trailing-image}
> [**Mildescape: Restaurant Hana**][mildescape]: Virtual Escape Room
> + I've got good memories of hanging out in a skype call playing Flash-based Escape Room games, so it was neat to see that Mildescape adapted to the Flash deprecation and started producing games in Unity.
> + Our group made a lockdown inspired return and played through one of their latest, 'Restaurant Hana'. Solid overall, brimming with the unique Mildescape art style, and puzzles that were generally logical and satisfying. 
>

#### Products
{: .underline}

{: .emphasis-panel}
> [**Untouched World**][untouched-world]: Sustainable Merino clothing from New Zealand
> + I own two items from this brand, but they're pretty much my favourite thing in the wardrobe. After seeing a pre-lockdown storewide sale (unfortunately over now), I couldn't resist adding another.
> + All of my UW gear is in their Mountainsilk fabric, which performs as advertised; temperature regulating, anti-microbial and can go months before needing a wash, and super light for travel. Looks good to boot!
