Both tools seem suited to digging holes at a casual glance. The jackhammer exudes power, modernity, and confers a bit of macho bravado on the skilled operator who manages to control the heavy frame. The shovel, trite by comparison, seems ancient, perhaps more like the tool of the home handyman rather than a true professional.

In reality, it's clear that comparing them is a fallacy â€“ all depends upon what kind of hole you need to dig. Concrete or rock strata in your way? Bring a jackhammer (and a shovel, to clear out the debris after!), and pay the price that must be paid for it to get the job done. But if you want to dig up some soil in your backyard? Shovel, every time.

Excuse the indulgent metaphor, but it can be painfully apparent whether a team has considered what kind of hole they need to dig before reaching for the tools.
