A few weeks ago, I published the first part of this post series. It was brought on by the realisation that whilst I take a meticulous, considered approach towards understanding use cases and selecting appropriate tooling/architecture at work; my own internet usage generally featured tools and processes that I'd adopted in an ad-hoc manner and gradually locked myself into at a younger age. 

While this is a personal process and the use cases, tools and outcomes will look a bit different for everyone, I'm sharing in case it helps kickstart the process for others that sympathise with the guiding principle: applying structured thought and planning to our use of the internet.

### Why?

First, I'd like to go back to that root question: _What do use the internet for?_ Not the easiest to answer, and a moving target in an era of all-pervading technology. But it's a question well worth pondering.

Backed by enormous sums of R&D capital, my industry too often drifts down the road of optimising for engagement, sometimes at the expense of the experience and outcomes for end-users. Our time is under constant barrage from artificially boosted 'attention captors', backed by teams of our brightest minds figuring out how to occupy an ever-increasing portion of our day. This is a topic in of itself — Tim Wu writes compellingly on the subject in his book, [The Attention Merchants][the-attention-merchants] — so, for now, I'll leave it as a bold statement that I believe to be true.

A key insight is that we have products and services that measure success by how much of your time they occupy; whether that be a plain time-on-app/service metric or a derivative figure like the number of interactions/volume of user data generated. However, as a user, you're generally pushing the opposite way. Apart from time allocated for pure entertainment, success for a user is often marked by achieving your goals while investing the minimum amount of time and effort.

On the face of it, we can see how this situation could arise even with the best of intentions – if you assume people engage with a service because it improves their lives, then, the more time spent, the better for everyone! Unfortunately, ['what gets measured gets managed'][be-careful-what-you-measure]... and I believe widespread measurement of engagement has increased the need to carefully consider how we effectively manage our time online.

Intentional or not, we have a system that wins your business with a proposition of keeping in touch with your distant nieces, nephews, and old friends. You check your 'News Feed', driven by algorithms defining success by interactions and data volume, following pages that seem interesting and liking a few articles.

In its goal to present the most engaging things and occupy more of your time the system has taken a person wanting to keep in touch with friends and family, and wound up dishing out an endless stream of politically charged content, accessible 24/7 from a pocket or handbag. And, based on traditional product metrics that get reported up to investors, this story is a resounding success!

For current purposes, I hope this illustrates the dangers we navigate daily when using 'free' products that seek to capture our time. It's not that I think these products are inherently bad, many of them provide wonderful feature offerings at a very accessible starting price of zero... but it's important to consider the dynamics at play, and take time to consider what we want out of the internet. As a whole, it can be remarkably good at sponging up time, data and money without our best interests at heart if you plunge in and let it take the lead!

### A digital diary

So, how to go about formulating a list of our online use cases? It's a fairly abstract question with a very long, evolving list of potential answers, and it can be difficult to make it 'concrete' enough to be useful. One approach that I found useful was logging and journaling – a 'digital diary'.

I started by noting the internet-enabled apps, tools and services that I used throughout an unremarkable day. I flick my phone on in the morning and open up the notification drawer, looking for alerts from Gmail, WhatsApp and Instagram. Open up Commsec to check stock positions. Brew a coffee, fire up the PC and read the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Financial Review and Reddit/Hacker News for the daily updates. At lunch, head to a café with a friend, using Google Maps to find the place, Google Photos to take and archive photo of our catchup, and Monzo to transfer money to split the bill. Get back home, load up the Netflix app on the smart TV... you get the idea.

With a firm starting point, I started trying to map each application/service and its features to my underlying use cases. I found it challenging to keep my use cases abstract enough to avoid framing them around the specific capabilities/implementations of the tools I currently use, but concrete enough to be something I can evaluate. I took inspiration from the [five whys][five-whys] method to go as far as necessary with each app. For example; an excerpt from my notes:

| Tool | Why do I use it? | But why? | But why? |
|------|------------------|----------|----------|
| WhatsApp | To communicate with friends. | To read and share news, stories and things I enjoy. | To maintain relationships, boost my mood, and learn new things. |
| Commsec | Checking stock positions, placing orders. | To invest my capital in companies aligned with my interests, and ideally make some returns while doing so. | N/A |
| Instagram | To see and share snippets of life with friends and family; occasional messaging. | To keep 'in the loop' while abroad; the 'entry barrier' on messaging is lower when you can reply to a photo to start the conversation. | To maintain relationships, boost my mood, and learn new things. | 
| Google Photos | Viewing and searching my photo library, no-effort backups from the phone camera | To preserve my visual memories and interesting moments and make them more accessible (timeline view, AI tagging) | N/A | 

Now, it's time to add another column. I tried to think about ways I use these tools that aren't in line with my idealised intent. Any ideas I tease out here means I can either update my reasons for using the product, or I've found a piece of my day that can be reclaimed :). To continue my example:

| Tool | Non-ideal usage |
|------|-----------------|
| Whatsapp | Having concentration periods interrupted with notifications. I have a bad tendency to react to all messages like they all might be the most important things I'll ever read; consistently breaking focus to triage that incoming message ping. In reality, the vast majority can wait, and people tend to follow up with a call if it's truly time-critical. |
| Commsec | I feel like my use of this app is consistent with why I have it, and it meets my goals. |
| Instagram | The notification issue with WhatsApp applies here as well. Scrolling through my feed, there are a load of accounts I whimsically followed that aren't personal connections or even particularly interesting most of the time. |
| Google Photos | A great tool, and available free (although I pay for extra storage). What's the cost? As far as I can ascertain, personalised ads (by default). Photos are stored in Google Drive, which permits uploaded content to be analyzed and used for ad-targeting. I believe this can be disabled by stopping personalisation on [Ads Settings][ads-settings]. |

The goal of this exercise was to avoid having my usage framed by the product/service I've adopted. I found it helped me understand the place of each tool in my life bit better, prompting changes in my behaviour to keep them in a place where they're working for me (and not the other way around!)

If you'd like to take it a bit further, I'd recommend extending the evaluation of each tool to consider the costs incurred; both obvious ones like financial costs, and the more subtle ones, like your time and data. If the cost-benefit is looking particularly bad for any of them, it's a good opportunity to try life without them for a while, or to put in some research and see if there may be a better alternative.

That's it for now! The next part of [this series][digital-footprints] will be a bit less abstract, looking at how I manage some of the personal data I store online and keep it secure&trade;.
